            <p class="paragraph">Greetings, Challenger! Welcome to the realm of chess.ad.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As the white player, youâ€™ll face off against a challenging black opponent (our not-so-friendly A.I). To make your move, simply click on the piece you'd like to move, then select its destination.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Chess.ad is designed to make chess accessible for beginners. When you choose a piece, valid move options will be highlighted for you. You can also review previous moves using the arrow buttons and reset the game at any time. But remember, a true strategist never retreats!</p>

          to familiarize yourself with the rules.
  Chess.ad implements most of these rules, with the exception of draws (other than stalemate), resigning, and time limits.
